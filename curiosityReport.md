Researching the origin of the Agile movement

## What it is
- an approach to software dev covering many different principles
## How it started
- started with a Manifesto for Agile Software Development
- there were other iterative software development methods advocated for since the late 1950's
- Scrum was one in 1995 that has some common aspects with Agile
- 17 devs met at a resort in snowbird utah to discuss lightweight dev methods, they made the manifesto
- Ten years later created a guide of best practices called the Agile glossary
## Who started it
- The "Agile Alliance"
    - the AA were 17 software devs in 2001, met at a resort

## Why it started
- looks like a pushback against business culture and practices that frustrated them
## How it works
- The agile manifesto reads:
"We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan
That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more."
- the principles they list as inspiring the manifesto are:
Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.
Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months).
Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers.
Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted.
Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location).
Working software is the primary measure of progress.
Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace.
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design.
Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly.

- focus on short development times and incremental changes
- focus on short "scrum" meetings instead of lengthy ones that focus on accountability for next steps

## Pros and cons?
- pro:
- focus on fast dev of working stuff focused on functionality
- askes for frequent testing during development
- con:
- loses focus on still important aspects like documentation, contracts, and business best practice
- progress reports and timelines might be harder to define

## How its doing
- has some vocal critics in recent years who question if it improves the process or not

## My takeaways
- To be honest agile software dev seems to me to be definitely the product of some coders. The manifesto is a pushback of culture, the priniples sort of relate but try and straddle between being principles and practices. If anything the manifesto is a statement of values, and the principles need to be divided into overarching principles, and then associated applications of those principles. As it is I think its hard to get a cohesive view of what agile software dev means in practice with just the manifesto, and principles documents, this only helps detractors as it makes it easier to draw different conclusions than the founders intended.
